Next Objectives:
  Allow subscriptions to other servers

There are two ways to allow edits:
- Allow/Deny

I want to do all my editing through Methods:
-- I can call methods on remote servers.
-- I can more closely tie permissions to actions

Advantages to using allow deny:
-- centralize the permission code

What happens if I use both?
- Stubs are not trusted
- Not sure if allow/deny will work on remote servers. I need to login to Meteor's accounts system on the remote server as well as the primary.

Here's what happens:
We are authenticated with the primary.
We have these by default on the client:
{
  username: "cool_kid_13", // unique name
  emails: [
    // each email address can only belong to one user.
    { address: "cool@example.com", verified: true },
    { address: "another@different.com", verified: false }
  ],
  profile: {
    // The profile is writable by the user by default.
    name: "Joe Schmoe"
  },
}
